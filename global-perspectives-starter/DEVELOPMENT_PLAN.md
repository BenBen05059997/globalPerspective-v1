# Global Perspectives News Aggregator - Development Plan

## Project Overview

**Global Perspectives** is an AI-agent-driven news aggregator that provides today-only news coverage with a unique perspective-based approach. The system fetches real-time news, processes and classifies articles as "local" vs "foreign" based on publisher country vs story origin country, and presents comparative viewpoints on the same events.

### Key Features
- **Today-only focus**: Current day news only
- **Perspective-based grouping**: Local vs international coverage comparison
- **Multi-language support**: Built-in language parameter support
- **Geographic classification**: Story origin country identification
- **AI-powered processing**: Ready for LLM integration
- **Deduplication**: Fuzzy matching to remove similar articles

### Current Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Pydantic
- **Agent**: Simple orchestrator coordinating news processing pipeline
- **Tools**: Modular tools (fetch, normalize, classify, summarize, present)
- **AI/ML**: Meta LLaMA (via AWS Bedrock) for intelligent summarization and analysis
- **Dependencies**: httpx, spaCy, geopy, rapidfuzz, boto3 (for AWS Bedrock integration)
