## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Data Loading Efficiency
- Optimized JSON data loading with proper error handling
- Efficient in-memory data structures for fast lookups
- Lazy loading of spaCy models to reduce startup time

### Processing Optimizations
- Batch processing of location detection
- Efficient deduplication algorithms
- Optimized pattern matching with compiled regex

### Memory Management
- Proper resource cleanup in location detection
- Efficient data structure usage
- Minimal memory footprint for large datasets

## üîç Debugging & Issue Resolution

### Major Issues Resolved

#### Issue 1: Country Detection Returning Empty Strings
**Problem**: Countries data was not loading correctly due to JSON structure mismatch
**Solution**: Fixed data loading to handle "countries" wrapper object in JSON
**Result**: Country detection now works perfectly with 17 countries loaded

#### Issue 2: Cities Data Not Loading
**Problem**: JSON structure used "major_cities" key instead of expected "cities"
**Solution**: Updated JSON structure to use correct key naming
**Result**: 423 cities now loading correctly

#### Issue 3: spaCy Model Not Available
**Problem**: English language model not installed for NER
**Solution**: Installed spacy and en_core_web_sm model
**Result**: Location detection fully functional
