### Simplify Homepage Layout - Restore Original Clean Design
- **Layout Simplification:** Removed expandable sources list feature and helper text to restore the cleaner, simpler layout from before Jan 20. Both desktop and mobile now show just AI action buttons (Summarize, Predict, Trace Cause) plus a single "View Sources ↗" link that opens Google News search.
- **Desktop Layout:** AI buttons in pill-shaped toolbar on left, "View Sources ↗" link on right, space-between layout. Removed "Sources (N)" expandable button and helper text note.
- **Mobile Layout:** Dropdown "Actions" button containing all three AI actions, plus "View Sources ↗" link below. Maintains separate container from desktop to prevent style conflicts.
- **Code Cleanup:** Removed unused `sourcesExpanded` state, `toggleSourcesExpanded` function, and entire expandable sources display section. Simplified JSX structure while preserving separate desktop/mobile layout containers added on Jan 20.
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/Home.jsx` to simplify both desktop (lines 424-473) and mobile (lines 475-537) layout containers, removing sources expansion functionality and helper text.

### Separate Desktop/Mobile Layout Implementation
- **Architecture Refactoring:** Implemented completely separate layout containers to eliminate CSS conflicts between desktop and mobile views. Created `.topic-actions-desktop` and `.topic-actions-mobile` containers that are independently controlled via CSS media queries, preventing cross-contamination of styles.
- **Desktop Layout Container:** `.topic-actions-desktop` shows only on screens >768px with horizontal flexbox layout, preserving original desktop button arrangement with "Summarize", "Predict", "Trace Cause" buttons on left and source links on right using `justify-content: space-between`.
- **Mobile Layout Container:** `.topic-actions-mobile` shows only on screens ≤768px with vertical layout, featuring full-width "Actions" dropdown and vertically-stacked source links below. Mobile container completely independent from desktop styles.
- **CSS Media Query Strategy:** Desktop layout: `display: flex` by default, `display: none !important` on mobile. Mobile layout: `display: none` by default, `display: block !important` on mobile. This ensures zero visual interference between layouts.
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/Home.jsx` by replacing shared container with separate `.topic-actions-desktop` and `.topic-actions-mobile` containers (lines 424-611), each with their own AI toolbar and source links structure.
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/AIComponents.css` with new layout container styles (lines 702-783), replacing previous shared container approach with completely independent desktop/mobile styling systems.

### Previous Changes (Earlier today)
- **Mobile UI Enhancement - Dropdown Actions:** Fixed mobile button UI issues by implementing a responsive dropdown pattern. Desktop maintains original circular buttons ("Summarize", "Predict", "Trace Cause"), while mobile (≤768px) shows a single "Actions" dropdown with all three options. Mobile dropdown features proper touch targets (44px minimum), loading spinners, completion checkmarks (✓), click-outside-to-close, and smooth animations. Eliminates text overflow and distorted circular shapes on iPhone.
- **Mobile Layout Improvements:** Enhanced mobile layout with proper spacing and alignment. Actions dropdown now spans full width with larger padding (16px), source links properly stack below on mobile with improved touch targets. Fixed layout conflicts between toolbar and source links that caused alignment issues.
- **Desktop Layout Restoration:** Fixed desktop layout regression by wrapping layout styles in `@media (min-width: 769px)` query and restoring original inline flexbox styles. Desktop now maintains exact original horizontal layout with buttons on left and source links on right, while mobile keeps vertical stacking layout.
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/AIComponents.css` with mobile dropdown styles (lines 119-226), responsive display logic (lines 574-583), mobile layout improvements (lines 697-733), and desktop-specific layout preservation (lines 220-234).
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/Home.jsx` with mobile dropdown state management, action handlers, click-outside event listener, and improved container structure.

## 2026-01-09
- **Timeline Visualization Enhancement:** Replaced plain text timeline with vertical timeline visualization featuring black dots, gray connecting lines, date badges, and event cards with hover effects. Event titles are color-coded by stage: blue (starting events), orange (evolving events), red (result events). Uses hybrid keyword + position detection for intelligent color assignment.
- **Timeline Parsing Fix:** Improved date detection to handle bullet points (`- 2020:`), prose format (`In 2020, something happened`), and dates anywhere in line (not just at start). Added fallback to plain markdown rendering if no dates detected. Strips leading prepositions and separators for cleaner titles.
- **Impact Breakdown Visualization:** Replaced vague numeric scores (9/10) with visual bar chart showing real-world impact. Displays three categories (People 👥, Economy 💰, Regional 🌍) with colored bars (red=High, orange=Moderate, blue=Low) and plain-language explanations extracted from AI response. Removes `**` markdown artifacts for clean display. Filters out duplicate Impact Score text from tab content.
- **Stricter Verdict Classification:** Implemented hybrid scoring system to prevent "True Signal" inflation. True Signal requires: (1) Average impact score ≥8, (2) At least 2 categories ≥8, (3) Global keywords in explanations ("global", "war", "pandemic", "supply chain", etc.). Worth Watching requires moderate scores (≥5) or regional keywords ("regional", "tensions", "spillover"). Everything else classified as Noise.
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/AIComponents.css` with timeline styles (lines 319-448) and impact breakdown styles (lines 450-568): impact-breakdown-container, impact-bar-fill with color classes, responsive mobile layout.
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/TraceCauseDisplay.jsx` with parseTimelineEvents() for date extraction, impactBreakdown parsing to extract Human Impact/Economic Reach/Geopolitical Stability scores and explanations, renderImpactBreakdown() to display visual bars, and hybrid verdict calculation logic (lines 168-217).

## 2026-01-08
- **UI Enhancement - Design System:** Added 60+ CSS variables for spacing (8px scale), typography (6 sizes), colors, shadows, and transitions. Replaces hardcoded values with maintainable design tokens across the application. Variables include `--space-xs` through `--space-3xl` (4px-32px), `--font-size-xs` through `--font-size-xl` (11px-16px), `--radius-sm` through `--radius-full`, shadow scales, and transition timings.
- **UI Enhancement - Chain Reaction Flow:** Replaced simple arrow visualization with numbered step cards (① ② ③) featuring violet left borders, hover effects (translateX + shadow), and gradient arrow connectors with downward chevrons. Makes prediction chain steps visually distinct and scannable. Single-step chains display as simplified cards without numbers.
- **UI Enhancement - Mobile Responsiveness:** Added comprehensive media queries for mobile devices (≤768px, ≤480px breakpoints). Tabs now stack vertically on mobile with full-width layout, left border indicators for active state, and 44px minimum touch targets for WCAG 2.1 compliance. Removed inline width/flex styles that blocked CSS media query control.
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/index.css` with global CSS variables (lines 20-85).
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/AIComponents.css` with accent color variants, chain reaction styles (lines 218-317), and mobile media queries (lines 318-398).
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/PredictionDisplay.jsx` with card-based chain rendering logic (lines 94-130) and removed inline tab styles (lines 183-200).
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/TraceCauseDisplay.jsx` by removing inline tab styles (lines 317-334).

## 2026-01-07
- **Map Country Flags (Complete):** Added country flag emojis to all map UI elements for consistent visual recognition. Flags now appear in: (1) Info window popup when clicking markers, (2) Article list modal when clicking "View all X articles", and (3) Fallback SVG map info panel. All display country flags (🇺🇸, 🇫🇷, 🇯🇵, etc.) with 🌍 globe fallback for unknown countries.
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/WorldMap.jsx` with shared `getFlagEmoji()` utility function and flag display in all three UI contexts.
- **Trace Cause UI Enhancement:** Replaced numeric "Impact: X/10" badge with qualitative Verdict Banner. Now displays AI classification (True Signal 🔴 / Worth Watching 🟠 / Noise 🟢) with 1-sentence explanation above tabs. Provides clearer, more meaningful insights than arbitrary scores.
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/TraceCauseDisplay.jsx` with verdict parsing logic, helper functions, and banner UI component.

## 2025-12-23
- Cache resilience: Serve stale topics with `stale: true` instead of 503 in `amplify/backend/function/newsSensitiveData/src/index.js`.
- Topics hook: Track `isStale`, `updatedAt`, `hasNewData`, store updatedAt in cache, and add background polling in `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/hooks/useGeminiTopics.js`.
- Home UI: Display freshness timestamp and "New topics available" banner in `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/Home.jsx`.
- Client: Pass through `stale` from the proxy response in `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/utils/graphqlService.js`.

## 2025-11-02
- Regional Categorization: Implemented intelligent topic organization by region (Asia, Africa, North America, Europe, Middle East, South America, World). Topics are automatically categorized based on country/region keywords and displayed in separate cards with regional headers and topic counts.
- Increased Topic Limit: Expanded from 7 to 10 topics to provide broader global coverage across all regions.
- Enhanced UI Design: Added regional section headers with visual separators, topic counts, and improved spacing. All existing AI features (summarize, predict) now work within each regional section.
- Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/Home.jsx` with categorization utility function.
- Modified `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/hooks/useGeminiTopics.js` to request 10 topics instead of 7.

## 2025-11-01
- Responsive Header: Added dropdown navigation for mobile devices (≤768px). Header height now remains fixed with dropdown expanding below brand text. Includes click-outside functionality and smooth animations. Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx` and `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/index.css`.

## 2025-10-11
- Sources Link: Use exact homepage title for Google News queries; removed title shortening and keyword augmentation. Updated `global-perspectives-starter/frontend/src/components/Home.jsx`.
- Credentials: Removed OpenAI key from env examples; marked Gemini key optional; updated proxy/docs to treat OpenAI integration as optional.

## 2025-10-09
- Security: Restored direct Amplify AppSync configuration; removed Vite env usage for AppSync.
- Configuration: Added root `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files; committed sanitized `.env.example` and `frontend/.env.example`.
- Search UX: Shortened topic titles for Google News queries; added location hints; kept 24-hour window.
- Consistency: Unified Home and Map “View sources →” link logic to use the same query builder.
- UI: Removed article list under the map.

## Setup Notes
- AppSync configuration is read from the bundled Amplify config. No `frontend/.env` is required for AppSync.
- Use `.env` at repo root only for backend service keys if needed; do not commit real keys.
